# System_Report

This bash script is super handy for checking how much storage space you're using, as well as the overall usage on your system storage. Plus, it also displays the system uptime so you can easily see how long your system has been running. 

Pretty neat, huh? To use this script, simply open a terminal and type in the following command: "bash System_Report.sh." Once the script is running, you'll see all the info mentioned above. Easy peasy! So go ahead and give it a try - I'm sure you'll find it useful.
